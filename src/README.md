This folder contains all the bot's code.  
It has two main files:
- `sharding.js` that starts the sharding process of the bot
- `bot.js` which is the code that gets executed initially for each spawned shard

Then it has 3 folders:
- `commands` contains all the bot commands 
- `config` contains some important configuration files
- `core` where most of the logic of the bot is placed
